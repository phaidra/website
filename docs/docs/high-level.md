PHAIDRA extends the popular [Fedora Repository](https://fedora.lyrasis.org/) with an integrated stack of broader open source tools, libraries, components, and APIs. With these extensions one can provide all the necessary functionality to deliver intuitive end-user-focused services for academics and researchers; archivists, librarians, and curators; as well as more sophisticated digitisation projects.

## PHAIDRA UI

Data repositories can be a confusing and intimidating place. The PHAIDRA user interface is geared towards making it simple for non-technical users to store, share and find data and digital assets in line with required data management plans. 


## PHAIDRA VUE Components

Our framework of VUE JavaScript components make it easy for organisations and more ambitious projects to develop web applications, custom user interfaces and lightweight applications based on any assets in the repository. PHAIDRA VUE Components give JavaScript developers fast, simple access to all the features we use in our UI, with the ability to reuse, remix and build on them to create something new.

You can check out the list of partners to [get a feeling for different customizations](/community/list-of-partners/) that institutions have already achieved. From online museums, libraries and archives to field-specific applications from archeology to the arts.


## PHAIDRA API

The PHAIDRA API offers access to the features of the PHAIDRA stack through a REST API. 

The API delivers more than simple access to the data, with the ability to access the full functionality of the PHAIDRA stack as a set of services. This includes all the necessary workflow and methods around an object, for example image provision, streaming or upload verification. 

PHAIDRA API offers a straightforward, technology-agnostic option for developers, providing a helpful and powerful set of API services, through a set of clearly-structured JSON calls.
