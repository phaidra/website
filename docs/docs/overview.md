## Goal of PHAIDRA Documentation

The aim of these docs is to give developers like yourself all the guidance you need to:

- fire up and configure your own PHAIDRA instance
- maintain your own instance
- customize the User Interface to your hearts (and your bosses') desire

> ðŸš¨ the current documentation is very bare bones and is a work in progress

## Introduction

PHAIDRA extends the popular [Fedora Repository](https://fedora.lyrasis.org/) with an integrated stack of broader open source tools, libraries, components, and APIs. With these extensions one can provide all the necessary functionality to deliver intuitive end-user-focused services for academics and researchers; archivists, librarians, and curators; as well as more sophisticated digitisation projects.
