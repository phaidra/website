# Partners

The repository PHAIDRA is used by many institutions across Europe. Over 20 instances are currently up and running.

The way how the repository is integrated in each institution is different. Some run the default installation, some customize their User Interface. Some host their owns PHAIDRA, while others provide hosting for additional partners. As a result, some partners don't use their own installation, they are served by a PHAIDRA installation from another institution.
