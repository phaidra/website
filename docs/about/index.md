# More Than Just a Repository

PHAIDRA is often refered to as a “repository”. It does everything a data and digital asset repository should do, but PHAIDRA is much more.

The project is built on the [Fedora Repository](https://fedora.lyrasis.org/) - one of the most popular and, in our opinion the best, Open Source repository available. But PHAIDRA extends on Fedora with a broader, integrated stack of Open Source tools, libraries, components and APIs. The end result is a far more comprehensive and user-friendly digital asset management solution that removes the complexity of data management for non-technical users, as well as providing a set of time-saving building blocks for more ambitious digital projects.

PHAIDRA is focused on simplifying digital management plans and delivering modern digital services. The comprehensive stack of open technologies makes it easier for projects to not just store, but to share, reuse and repurpose digital assets. And, in line with FAIR data principles, PHAIDRA ensures data can be found, accessed, integrated and reused by others.
More than just a data store, we aim that the archive becomes a place where research data and digital assets go to live in the open.
