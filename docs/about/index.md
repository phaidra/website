# Overview

PHAIDRA is focused on simplifying digital management plans and delivering modern digital services. The comprehensive stack of open technologies makes it easier for projects to not just store, but to share, reuse and repurpose digital assets. And, in line with FAIR data principles, PHAIDRA ensures data can be found, accessed, integrated and reused by others.

PHAIDRA extends the popular Fedora Repository with an integrated stack of broader open source tools, libraries, components and APIs. PHAIDRA provides a more comprehensive digital asset management solution that removes the complexity of data management for non-technical users, as well as providing a set of time-saving building blocks for more ambitious digital projects.

The PHAIDRA project provides a powerful, flexible, free and Open Source solution for managing research data and digital assets within universities and across a broader range of public and private institutions and research organisations.

In all areas of research, both state and private sponsors now demand data management plans, more open data, and they are increasingly attracted to digital innovation. As a result, the best projects and researchers are being attracted to the institutions that make this easier.

Delivering intuitive user-friendly applications, and giving projects the ability to innovate with data and digital assets, demands far more than just a working data repository. PHAIDRA offers an integrated stack of open source technologies that remove the complexity of data management for non-technical users, as well as provideing a set of time-saving building blocks for more ambitious digital projects.

More than just a data store, we aim that the archive becomes a place where research data and digital assets go to live and be reused.
