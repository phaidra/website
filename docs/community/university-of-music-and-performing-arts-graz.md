A steadily increasing number of digital objects of a great variety lead the library of the Kunstuniversität Graz to use PHAIDRA for the main aim to store, preserve and make searchable relevant metadata. We primarily archive and describe the university's theses and use PHAIDRA as repository for the output of digitization projects (scanning music manuscripts and autographs). Metadata describing cultural estates and heritages are delivered to the European Digital Library. Digital representations are also linked to the library's online catalogue.
