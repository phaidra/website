Established in 1996, the St. Pölten UAS (Fachhochschule St. Pölten) currently has roughly 3,500 students enrolled in 28 full- and part-time programmes. Focusing on the three core areas of Health and Social Sciences, Business and Technology, St. Pölten UAS offers both undergraduate and postgraduate courses and has established itself as a leading institute of higher education in eastern Austria. PHAIDRA is currently in the pilot phase and used as a long-term memory base for university publications. Subsequently, it is mainly employed to secure the publications of the research department. We also hope that in the long term, media productions of students find their way into the repository.
