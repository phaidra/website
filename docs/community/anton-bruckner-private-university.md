The *[Anton Bruckner Private University](https://www.bruckneruni.at/)* for music, drama and dance is setting up an institutional repository for its digital objects. Students' theses, a selection of audio and video recordings, the output of the library's digitisation projects and more will be permanently stored and made accessible with PHAIDRA. Thus, PHAIDRA will be a valuable source of information in addition to the University's Library catalogue and our discovery service *[AnTon](https://phaidra.bruckneruni.at/)*.
