University for Continuing Education Krems is the leading public university for continuing education in Europe. Founded in 1995, it has about 9000 students, nearly half of them having more than 15 years of professional experience. In more than 200 postgraduate study programmes, the study model is oriented toward the specific requirements of adult learners in all phases of life and especially to the needs of working professionals. Blended learning formats to support part-time study for working professionals are offered. Teaching and research are focused on today’s social, organizational and technical issues. For this reason, the University specifically focuses on interdisciplinary, cross-linked, future-oriented fields of specialization in the faculties “Health and Medicine”, “Business and Globalization” and “Education, Art and Architecture.” 

As part of our research data management, we’re establishing PHAIDRA at our University not only to guarantee long-term availability  to our scientists‘ research results but also to make these research output accessible and visible to the public. PHAIDRA shall ease inter-faculty collaboration as well as co-working with external institutions. We want to provide access to faculty members‘ scientific articles and to publications from our university press called „Edition Donau-Universität Krems“.
