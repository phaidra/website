PHAIDRA is the Digital Humanities Archive of the Ca' Foscari University of Venice. PHAIDRA was launched in 2014 by the University Library System (SBA) with the goal of making available the important historical materials held in Ca' Foscari libraries collections and celebrate Ca' Foscari 150th anniversary in 2018. The first collection, Storia di Ca' Foscari, was created with this purpose.

Actually PHAIDRA hosts more than 200 collections digitised by Ca' Foscari University (archive, libraries, departments and University press) with various multidisciplinary objects, such as images, text documents, books and videos.

In accordance with the University open access policy, most of the digitised materials are available for free download, not only for the academic community.
