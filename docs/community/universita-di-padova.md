In the course of its 800-year history, the University of Padova has enriched its heritage with a number of historical buildings, scientific instruments, natural science and medicine collections, iconographic materials, archaeological finds, paintings, manuscripts and books. The Phaidra - Digital collections website of the University Library System of Padova shows part of this cultural heritage - coming from archives, museums and libraries - allowing the vast public to enjoy rare or valuable documents, of substantial historical, artistic, cultural, academic interest, otherwise not easily accessible. The most interesting and the recently published amongst the collections are presented in Home page. The full list can be found at Featured collections page.

## Partnerships
Some digital collections are also accessible via Europeana, the vast European digital library. Since April 2010, the University of Padova and the University of Vienna have begun a partnership for the use and future development of PHAIDRA. Since 2014, the Universities Ca' Foscari and IUAV, in Venice, publish their digital collections on PHAIDRA.
